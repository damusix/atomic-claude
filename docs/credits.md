# Credits and comparison


Atomic Claude stands on the shoulders of three projects. This doc records what each one did well, what atomic-claude borrowed, and where it diverges. If atomic-claude's tradeoffs don't fit your style, one of these probably will.


## Credits


**[caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)** (Julius Brussee). 61k stars at time of writing, and earned. Caveman pioneered the compressed-output pattern for Claude Code and proved you can ship ~65% token savings without sacrificing technical accuracy. The intensity-level naming (lite / full / ultra) atomic-claude uses comes straight from there. Install it if its style fits you. Why this repo exists alongside it: caveman's voice is ooga-booga by design, and I wanted something that read more like a colleague. Full sentences when they help, diagrams and code blocks where they communicate better than prose, terse only where terseness wins.


**[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** (Jesse Vincent / obra). The most comprehensive skill toolkit for Claude Code I've used. The TDD discipline, verification-before-completion, subagent-driven development, and worktree workflows that atomic-claude leans on are all superpowers territory. It's the right answer for a lot of workflows. Why this repo exists alongside it: superpowers leans hard on auto-firing skills by design. `brainstorming` will kick in and start drafting a design spec on a single offhand comment. That's the intended UX, and for some flows it's perfect; for what I wanted, it was overbearing. Atomic-claude keeps the same disciplines but moves most of them into explicit slash commands you reach for on purpose.


**[stop-slop](https://github.com/hardikpandya/stop-slop)** (Hardik Pandya, MIT). The rule set behind `atomic-prose`. Stop-slop is a focused skill for removing predictable AI patterns from prose (throat-clearing, em dashes, marketing jargon, false agency). Atomic Claude's `atomic-prose` skill adapts those rules for developer documentation: kept the anti-marketing core, the active-voice requirement, and the no-em-dash rule; dropped essay-targeted guidance (manufactured profundity, performative sincerity); added a boundary against the atomic TUI style and a "keep some narrative" rule so doc prose does not collapse into telegraphic fragments. If you write blog posts or essays as well as docs, run stop-slop for the broader rule set.


Both caveman and superpowers are worth running on their own terms.

A few honest notes:


- **Atomic borrows visibly from both.** The intensity-level naming (lite / full / ultra) is straight from caveman. The skills + agents split, TDD discipline, verification gate, and worktree workflow are superpowers territory.
- **Atomic adds project-state awareness and a durable workflow.** Signals scanning, the `atomic` binary, reminders, CI watching, git cleanup, and the spec → implement → review loop with a `FOLLOWUPS.md` ledger are atomic-specific.
- **Atomic is more opinionated about explicit vs implicit.** Superpowers leans on auto-firing skills (it's the design point); atomic uses skills sparingly (6 of them) and pushes most behavior into explicit slash commands. Caveman is mixed: `/caveman` is a command but also auto-activates per session for supported agents.
