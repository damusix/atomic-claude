<push-flow>

1. `git branch --show-current` — record the branch.
2. `git status --porcelain` — if dirty, stop and tell the user to commit first.
3. `git log @{u}..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null` — show what is about to ship. If the branch has no upstream, that is expected (set in step 4).
4. Push:
    - No upstream → `git push -u origin <branch>`.
    - Upstream exists and branch is ahead → `git push`.
    - Already up to date → stop.
5. Print the resulting `<old>..<new> <branch> -> <branch>` line.

If push is rejected (non-fast-forward), stop and tell the user. Let them decide how to resolve it.
