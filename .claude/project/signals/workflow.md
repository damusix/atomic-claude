# workflow

## What it does

Plan → implement → ship lifecycle. Commands, agents, and skills that orchestrate feature work from spec to committed code. `/atomic-plan` produces specs; `/subagent-implementation` runs the implement→review loop with worktree isolation via the `worktree-setup` partial; `/commit` covers all ship escalation paths (push/PR/merge/squash) in one verb with automatic signals refresh and doc-impact checks.

## Artifacts

**Planning:**

- [`commands/gather-evidence.md`](../../../commands/gather-evidence.md) — pre-design evidence gathering against primary sources (context7, official docs, source code, `atomic code explore`/`callers`/`impact`); returns `SUPPORTED / UNSUPPORTED / MIXED / INCONCLUSIVE` with cited evidence trail
- [`commands/atomic-plan.md`](../../../commands/atomic-plan.md) — gauges triviality; trivial → inline spec; non-trivial → `docs/design/<topic>.md` + `docs/spec/<topic>.md` via subagent loop; optionally dispatches `atomic-investigator` and `atomic-strategist`; in the Diverge phase, when a design question is genuinely visual (layout, color, spacing, visual hierarchy, diagram shape), invokes `atomic-visual-options` skill just-in-time to render 2–4 variants as a throwaway HTML artifact; chosen codes are recorded in the design doc
- [`commands/pressure-test.md`](../../../commands/pressure-test.md) — Socratic challenger session; questions only, no code, no agents; paired with `/atomic-plan` as pre-approval gate or surfaced by the stuck-fix escalation in `/subagent-implementation`
- [`commands/atomic-help.md`](../../../commands/atomic-help.md) — routing assistant; reads intent, recommends one next action; never executes
- [`commands/atomic-setup.md`](../../../commands/atomic-setup.md) — repo bootstrap; audits [`.gitignore`](../../../.gitignore), [`docs/`](../../../docs) layout, [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) presence; proposes only what is absent, never overwrites (axiom 3)
- [`commands/atomic-improve.md`](../../../commands/atomic-improve.md) — session retrospective audit; mines session history for corrections, friction, and atomic-meta misbehavior

**Implementation loop:**

- [`commands/subagent-implementation.md`](../../../commands/subagent-implementation.md) — orchestrates implement→review loop; dispatches `atomic-investigator` first for surface-area mapping; writes `BRIEF.md`, `STATE.md`, `FOLLOWUPS.md` to `.claude/.scratchpad/<date>-<topic>/`; loops `atomic-implementer` + `atomic-reviewer` until `VERDICT: PASS`; commits per green iteration via `atomic-commit` skill; includes worktree-setup partial (interactive: asks user; hands-off: auto-creates); Phase 2 Step C carries stuck-fix escalation (2 consecutive `CHANGES_REQUESTED` on same root signal → surfaces `/pressure-test` + `atomic-strategist` RCA offer, user-gated); 6-iteration soft-stop is the outer bound; Phase 3 runs `atomic-verify`, surfaces `FOLLOWUPS.md` for user disposition, writes implementation log to spec, invokes `/documentation`
- [`commands/autopilot.md`](../../../commands/autopilot.md) — autonomous end-to-end delivery; takes `<task | issue#> [merge-verb]`; runs plan (no approval gate) → worktree-setup (auto-create, hands-off) → `/subagent-implementation` loop with overrides: every finding addressed in-iteration (`FOLLOWUPS.md` ends empty), `atomic-strategist` auto-dispatched on stuck (accepted autonomy cost), spec currency-clean before each dispatch; Ship gate is the only human decision; `atomic code index` runs automatically on cold index (no prompt).
- [`commands/subagent-diagnose.md`](../../../commands/subagent-diagnose.md) — failure-investigation orchestrator; `ci` mode seeds from failed GitHub Actions run; `bug` mode seeds from freeform symptom; same investigator + implementer + reviewer chain as `/subagent-implementation`
- [`commands/review-branch.md`](../../../commands/review-branch.md) — dispatches `atomic-reviewer` once on `<base>..HEAD`; no loop
- [`commands/session-report.md`](../../../commands/session-report.md) — writes timestamped why-context note to `.claude/.scratchpad/session-reports/<branch>/`; consumed by `/commit` before commit message synthesis, deleted after successful commit
- [`commands/_templates/implementer-prompt.md`](../../../commands/_templates/implementer-prompt.md) — runtime prompt partial consumed by `/subagent-implementation` and `/subagent-diagnose`; placeholders: `{SCRATCH_PATH}`, `{SPEC_PATH}`, `{ITERATION_SCOPE}`, `{REVIEWER_FEEDBACK}`, `{BASE_SHA}`
- [`commands/_templates/reviewer-prompt.md`](../../../commands/_templates/reviewer-prompt.md) — runtime prompt partial consumed by the same orchestrators; includes suppression-pattern check (Step 5)

**Ship verbs:**

- [`commands/commit.md`](../../../commands/commit.md) — unified ship verb; reads `$ARGUMENTS` for escalation tokens (`push`, `pr`, `merge`, `squash`, `squash merge`); with no token commits then prompts interactively via `AskUserQuestion`; delegates message format to `atomic-commit` skill; runs doc-impact check then signals refresh on every path; push path uses `git push -u origin <branch>` or `git push`; PR path creates via `gh pr create`; merge path prefers remote path (`gh pr merge`) when PR is open; squash path collapses via `git reset --soft`; detects worktrees on merge/squash and asks to delete
- [`commands/undo-commit.md`](../../../commands/undo-commit.md) — soft-resets last commit; refuses on merge commits, initial commit, already-pushed HEAD

**Agents dispatched by workflow commands:**

- [`agents/atomic-implementer.md`](../../../agents/atomic-implementer.md) — dual-mode implementation agent; `feature` mode: cohesion-bounded (one logical slice, any file count; bounces cross-cutting or ambiguous scope); `surgical` mode: hard cap of 2 files (bounces anything larger); both modes write TDD (failing test first, confirm fails, implement, confirm green); both report `## Did / ## Tests / ## Signals / ## Failed` block; mode declared by orchestrator in dispatch prompt
- [`agents/atomic-reviewer.md`](../../../agents/atomic-reviewer.md) — diff reviewer; verifies TDD signals were run; emits `VERDICT: PASS` or `VERDICT: CHANGES_REQUESTED`; includes suppression-pattern check
- [`agents/atomic-investigator.md`](../../../agents/atomic-investigator.md) — read-only code locator; returns `file:line — what` tables; dispatched first in `/subagent-implementation` Phase 0 to scope the surface area before any implementation; Haiku-backed
- [`agents/atomic-strategist.md`](../../../agents/atomic-strategist.md) — Opus-powered, read-only; "is this the right approach?" reasoning; dispatched when stuck-fix escalation fires (user-gated in `/subagent-implementation`; auto-dispatched in `/autopilot`)

**Skills auto-fired during workflow:**

- [`skills/atomic-tdd/`](../../../skills/atomic-tdd) — fires on test/implementation work; TDD discipline
- [`skills/atomic-verify/`](../../../skills/atomic-verify) — fires on "done", "fixed", "passing", "ready to merge" claims; invoked by `/subagent-implementation` Phase 3 orchestrator and by `/commit` merge preflight
- [`skills/atomic-commit/`](../../../skills/atomic-commit) — fires on commit message synthesis; invoked by all ship paths in `/commit` and by `/subagent-implementation` Step D per green iteration
- [`skills/atomic-review/`](../../../skills/atomic-review) — fires on review requests; provides PR title/body tone guidance invoked by the PR path in `/commit`
- [`skills/atomic-debug/`](../../../skills/atomic-debug) — fires on debugging/failure-investigation language; complements `/subagent-diagnose`
- [`skills/atomic-visual-options/`](../../../skills/atomic-visual-options) — fires on visual comparison requests ("show me a few options", "mock up some variants", "let me see this side by side", "compare these layouts"); renders 2–4 side-by-side variants per decision dimension as a single throwaway self-contained HTML file; user picks by typing terminal codes (e.g. `A2 B3`); also invoked just-in-time by `/atomic-plan` when a design question passes the see-it-over-read-it gate (layout, color, spacing, visual hierarchy, diagram shape — not conceptual or text decisions)

**YAGNI partial ([`templates/shared/agent-yagni.md`](../../../templates/shared/agent-yagni.md)):**

New shared partial (20th in the shared pool) composing the Simplicity-first (YAGNI) 7-step ladder into `atomic-implementer`, `atomic-reviewer`, and `atomic-strategist`. The ladder is kept verbatim in sync with the same text in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md)'s Principles block — edit both together (CLAUDE.md is not rendered, so the duplication is manual). Ladder stops at first hit: (1) skip if not needed; (2) stdlib; (3) native platform feature; (4) installed dep; (5) existing codebase solution; (6) one-liner; (7) minimum code that fully solves the problem.

## CLI code

None. The workflow domain is purely Claude Code artifacts (commands, agents, skills, shared partials). No Go packages implement workflow logic.

## Coupling

- → **bundle**: all commands under [`commands/`](../../../commands) are rendered from [`templates/commands/`](../../../templates/commands) + [`templates/shared/`](../../../templates/shared) partials via `make render`; the worktree-setup partial at [`templates/shared/worktree-setup.md`](../../../templates/shared/worktree-setup.md) is composed into `subagent-implementation` and `autopilot`; all agents under [`agents/`](../../../agents) are rendered from [`templates/agents/`](../../../templates/agents); [`commands/_templates/`](../../../commands/_templates) partials ship in the embedded bundle (require `go:embed all:bundle`); any template change requires `make render` then `make -C atomic bundle`
- → **signals**: `/commit` dispatches `atomic-signals-inferrer` in silent mode (via signals-gate partial) after each ship path when `atomic signals stale` exits 1; all ship escalation paths in `/commit` carry the same signals-refresh block; adding new ship paths must wire the same refresh
- → **config**: `/subagent-implementation` Phase 3 defers follow-ups via `atomic followups add` (config domain); session-report scratchpad at `.claude/.scratchpad/session-reports/<branch>/` is consumed and deleted by `/commit`; worktrees at `.worktrees/<branch>/` are detected and cleaned up on merge/squash
- → **docs-meta**: `/subagent-implementation` Phase 3 invokes `/documentation`; `/commit` runs doc-impact check against `## Documentation surfaces` table before committing; new commands or agents in this domain require updates to [`docs/reference/workflow.md`](../../../docs/reference/workflow.md) and the `/atomic-help` topic table
