## Code-intel index

When `.claude/.atomic-index/atomic.db` is present and `atomic` is on PATH, prefer `atomic code` verbs for location and relationship questions — they query a pre-built symbol graph and return results that grep cannot replicate:

- `atomic code search <symbol>` — where a symbol is defined and used (outranks sg/grep for this question)
- `atomic code callers <symbol>` — all callers of a function or method across the codebase
- `atomic code callees <symbol>` — all symbols a function calls
- `atomic code impact <symbol>` — blast radius of changing a symbol (transitive callers)

Use `--format json` for machine-parseable output when processing results programmatically.

**Bounded queries only.** Query one symbol at a time. Never attempt to dump or sweep the full graph; the index answers a specific question, it is not a corpus to read.

**Graceful degradation — non-negotiable.** Before querying, confirm the path is live: `atomic` on PATH, `.claude/.atomic-index/atomic.db` exists, and the query returns usable output. On any failure — binary absent, DB missing, query error — fall back silently to sg/grep/heuristics. Never print an error about the index being unavailable; never block because it is missing. The query is an enhancement; grep is the floor. This matters because the artifacts install into user repos that never ran `atomic code index`.

**Why the index exists.** It reflects working-tree state at the last `atomic code sync`. It is authoritative for existing symbols at that point in time. The orchestrator (not the subagent) owns keeping the index fresh — the subagent only queries.
