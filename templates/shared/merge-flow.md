<merge-preflight>

1. Invoke `atomic-verify` — confirm the branch is ready before merging.
2. Determine base:
   {{ template "base-resolution" . }}
3. `git branch --show-current` — if on base, stop: nothing to merge.
4. `git status --porcelain` — if dirty, stop: commit or stash first.
5. **Detect open PR:**
   ```
   gh pr view --json number,state -q '.state' 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - `OPEN` → use **remote path** (preferred — closes the PR cleanly via GitHub).
   - Otherwise → **local path**.
   - If `gh` is missing or unauthed, fall through to local path with a note.

   Remote path is preferred because a local merge + push does not auto-close the PR on GitHub — it stays open as "Not merged" indefinitely. `gh pr merge` is the only way to close it cleanly.

{{define "merge-flow-steps"}}
<merge-steps>

1. Record the feature branch name and PR number (if any).

2. **Execute the merge:**

    **Remote path** (PR open):
    1. `gh pr merge <PR#> --merge --delete-branch` — server-side merge, auto-closes the PR, removes remote branch.
    2. `git checkout <base>` then `git pull` to fast-forward local base.
    3. Record `MERGE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.

    **Local path** (no PR):
    1. `git checkout <base>` then `git pull`.
    2. `git merge <feature>`.
    3. Record `MERGE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.

3. **Re-run tests.** If tests fail:
    - Local path: ask about rolling back with `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD`.
    - Remote path: the merge SHA is already published. Offer `git revert` instead — never force-push the base branch.

4. **Update implementation logs.** Find spec files with an `## Implementation log` section in the merged diff:
    ```bash
    git diff --name-only ORIG_HEAD..HEAD | grep '^docs/spec/.*\.md$' | while read f; do
      grep -q '^## Implementation log' "$f" && echo "$f"
    done
    ```
    For each match, append: `**Merged into <base> as <MERGE_SHA> — <date>.**` Stage and commit as a follow-up. If none match, skip.

5. **Post-merge signals refresh:**
    {{ template "signals-gate" . }}
    If signals regenerate, commit as a follow-up: `chore(signals): refresh after merge of <feature>`. Push on remote path.

6. **Delete local feature branch:** `git branch -d <feature>`.
7. {{ template "worktree-cleanup-prompt" . }}
