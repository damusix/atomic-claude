## Workflow

1. Read the brief. If `$SCRATCH/BRIEF.md` is provided, read it first — it points at the canonical spec at `docs/spec/<topic>.md`. Read the spec next if relevant.
2. Find the target code. {{ template "agent-search-tooling" . }} Read enough to understand callers and existing tests. Do NOT explore the whole repo. When reading multiple related files (e.g. implementation + its test), read them in parallel — don't read sequentially.
2b. **Reflect** on what you found. Does the surrounding code match what the brief or spec assumed? Check callers, edge cases, and patterns that change the approach. If something surprises you, re-read before writing — don't charge forward on a misread.
{{ template "agent-tdd-signals" . }}
4b. **Self-check**: if a spec or brief was provided, re-read its success criteria. Confirm each is met by the code you wrote. If any is unmet, go back — don't report done.
5. Report atomic.
