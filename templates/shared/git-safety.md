- Use relative paths for `git add` based on the current working directory.
- Run each `git` command as a separate Bash call.
- On pre-commit hook failure: fix the root cause, re-stage, and create a new commit. The hook exists for a reason.
- Keep force-push off the base branch. If a rollback is needed, use `git revert` so the bad SHA stays in history.
